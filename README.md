# boostchildtemplate
This is a template for the creation of a child theme of boost

Change the next KEYWORDS in your template in order to set correctly the name for the child theme:
* NAME: The name of your new theme. In this case could be: Boost Child.
* PACKAGECODE: The shortname of your new theme. 
This package code is like a shortcode for our theme. It is the same name as the name of the folder located inside 
the /theme folder that contains our new theme.
For this case could be boostchild.

Also you need to change some file names in order to allow languages to work correctly.
For every lang folder you have to change the name of the file inside them. The file name must be 'theme_PACKAGECODE' 
changing the word PACKAGECODE for the one of your new theme.
